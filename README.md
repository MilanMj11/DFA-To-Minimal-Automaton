# DFA to minimal automaton
The program reads the automaton to be minimized from the "automaton.txt" file, following this format:

• Line 1: Initial state

• Subsequent lines: Node edge Node

• Last line: Final states

The minimized / minimal automaton is constructed in memory and printed in the "output.txt" file using the same format. The program also allows the verification of words on the new automaton
